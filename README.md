## Project Overview 

The purpose of this project was to create a timed multiple choice quiz application on JavaScript. The application runs in the browser and have clean user interface. What the quiz needed to include: 
* A starting page
* A timer that starts once the quiz began
* When one question was answered, another question generates
* If a question is answered wrong, time is deducted
* When the time is over or all questions are answered, the game is over and the user is taken to the end page to enter in initials and see high scores

## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 

Four different pages of HTML were created for this project. The start page, the game, high scores, and the end page. 

CSS was created that would apply to every part of the app along with separate pages for the game and high scores page. 

JavaScript pages were created for the game page, high scores, and the end page. JavaScript was used on the game page to move questions along, show green for correct answers and red for wrong, keep track of what question you are on, and for the timer. It was also used to log scores on local storage.
